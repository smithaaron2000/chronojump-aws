do that validation does the skin method and the black method, instead of
having a black method full of validation things
at end, validation should add compare code

findHoles should work only on ROIs (Region Of Interest). 
The best is to ask first user for the points and play with the threshold in
ROI (don't with the hole image). ROI is always in the middle of
point (in future, ROI is detected by kalvan)
If the point gets lost on that ROI, ask user again
Ability to record thresold for next person and load

max size of point should be marked vy software, and also size of ROI
(maybe in future, ROI of toe could be little than other ROIs (that move fast)
